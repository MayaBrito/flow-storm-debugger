   `config` should be a map containing :

        - `:styles` a string path to a css file if you want to override some started debugger styles

   When `:local?` is false you can also provide `:runtime-host` `:debugger-host` and `:port` for the nrepl server.
  `:runtime-host` should be the ip of the debuggee (defaults to localhost)
  `:debugger-host` shoud be the ip where the debugger is running, since the debuggee needs to connect back to it (defaults to localhost)"
